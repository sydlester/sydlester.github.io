          I have completed a minor in environmental science and policy, where I

          As a TA for Discrete Mathematics, I learned how to organize and
          explain deeply technical topics in different ways. I developed an
          intuition for identifying sources of misunderstanding or confusion and
          gained invaluable confidence and experience decomposing complex
          problems and designing solutions.

          I held office hours to individually assist students with assignments

        <p>
          I worked with a small team to develop TA training materials, write

          inductions portion of the course.

          I joined a multi-disciplinary team to study the effects of
          recreational beach usage on the nesting behavior of wild sea turtles.
          I learned teamwork, experimental design, and data collection and
          analysis techniquesâ€” including anomaly and pattern detection.

        <p>
          I worked with Marine Scientists and rangers from the National Park

          Cape Lookout National Seashore.

        <p>
          We used analysis to identify causal pathways and quantify
          relationships between different experimental parameters.

        <p>
          We documented results and presented recommendations for optimizing the
